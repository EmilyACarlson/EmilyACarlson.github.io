# Emily Makes an Online Presence that isn't Social Media weeeee (the irony).
## About: A place to share content, curate artistic style etc. Practise my writing and create something I am proud of. \

I have a number of different interests and please pick and choose what and where you want to read and engage. This is going to be bare bones for me and for you for a while until I get a better system up and running.\

Since you're all my friends reading this at this point I won't leave my contact information to get scraped by the internet robots, just call me or text me or email me feedbacks, musings, when things (like my brain) break etc. Or when you break your own brain from reading my blog. I am interested in seeing how people will react to this kind of communication and if it doesn't make sense it is either that way because of a comedic intention, clang intention, hyper active intention, ignorance or just it not actually making sense. As I have come to learn, I am not the best with details so there may be spelling errors, rendering issues, and much much more. Welcome to the outward presentation of the inner workings of my mind when allowed the freedom, time andsocae to wander.
