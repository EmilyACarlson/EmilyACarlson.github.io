# Emily Makes an Online Presence that isn't Social Media weeeee (the irony).
## About: A place to share content, curate artistic style etc. Practise my writing and create something I am proud of. \

I have a number of different interests and please pick and choose what and where you want to read and engage. This is going to be bare bones for me and for you for a while until I get a better system up and running.\

Since you're all my friends reading this at this point I won't leave my contact information to get scraped by the internet robots, just call me or text me or email me feedbacks, musings, when things (like my brain) break etc. Or when you break your own brain from reading my blog.
